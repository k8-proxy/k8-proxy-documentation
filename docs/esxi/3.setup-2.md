# Pre-requisites
* ESXI Server
* 9 IP Addresses
* Internet Access

# Setting up the environment
* Download 8 OVAs (preferably on a jump server, i.e. Controller)
* In Controller > Go to Browser > navigate to ESXI server that the controller belongs to 
* VM > Create/Register New VM > Deploy a virtual machine from an OVF or OVA file
  * minio-server offline (minio-server.ova)
  * wordpress (Glasswall-wordpress.ova)
  * shared storage (TrueNAS-Core.ova)
  * monitoring (visualog.ova)
  * gov.uk offline (GovUK.ova)
  * traffic gen (Traffic-Generator.ova)
  * support (SupportServer01.ova)
  * linux desktop (Linux-Desktop.ova)
  * ICAP client (icap_client.ova)
  * Proxy Rebuild (proxy-rebuild.ova)


## Changing IP for a VM*
*except for ICAP Client
### todo: add VM credentials 
* when logged in to a VM
  * run `ip a` to get the name of your network interface 
  * run `sudo vi /etc/netplan/$name_of_file`, where `$name_of_file` can be different from 1 VM to another, but will always have IP addresses and gateways that you can change accordingly. The yaml file should look something like this [**note**: eth0 is an example network interface, please use result from `ip a` command]: 
```
network:
  version: 2
    renderer: networkd
    ethernets:
      eth0:
        addresses:
          - 192.168.0.3/24 # Replace this with desired IP address in CIDR format
        gateway4: 192.168.0.1 # Replace this with desired gateway
        nameservers:
          addresses: [8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1] # Replace DNS servers if needed
```
  * after modification of IP and gateway, run `sudo netplan apply`
  * to verify your VM is connected to the internet, run `ping google.com`
  * you can now SSH into your VM as needed

# Linux Desktop Setup
* Once Ubuntu Desktop interface appears, login > Power button in the upper right corner > Settings > Network from the left side bar
* Edit Wired connection (click on settings button next to "Connected - 10000Mb/s")
  * go to IPV4 tab
  * set IPV4 method to Manual
  * add a valid IP address, netmask, and gateway
  * set the the DNS manual (set to off automatic button) and add the following 8.8.8.8

  * in the VM's terminal, run 
    ```
    nmcli connection down Wired\ connection\ 1
    nmcli connection up Wired\ connection\ 1
    ip a # verify correct address for ens160
    ```
* From Linux Desktop, open Firefox and verify home page is set to: https://github.com/k8-proxy/ESXI-setup-server/wiki

# Minio Server Setup
* In your local hosts file (win: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc, on MAC/Linux: /etc/hosts), add:
```
<VM IP_ADDRESS> minio.server
```

# Monitoring Setup
**todo**: there were no steps for exporting OVA except changing IP

# Gov.uk Setup 
* In your local hosts file (win: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc, on MAC/Linux: /etc/hosts), add:
```
<VM IP_ADDRESS> www.gov.uk assets.publishing.service.gov.uk www.gov.uk.local assets.publishing.service.gov.uk.local
``` 
* Download ca.pem from VM via `scp glasswall@<VM_IP>:/ca.pem <local/directory>`
* In Firefox > Preferences > View Certificates > Authorities > Import ca.pem > Trust this CA to identify websites > OK
* Navigate to [https://www.gov.uk](https://gov.uk) to access the project UI

## Proxy for Gov.uk
* To use Proxy Rebuild for this website, follow the steps from [here](#Proxy-Rebuild) and setup a Proxy Rebuild VM.
* Once done, The website can be accessed at [https://www.gov.uk](https://gov.uk) and verify the proxy by downloading a sample PDF file from [https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/915490/FOI_2020_08936.pdf](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/915490/FOI_2020_08936.pdf)
* The downloaded PDF should have “Glasswall Processed” watermark on the top right.

# Traffic Gen Setup
* Disable `cloud-init` network config by creating file `99-disable-network-config.cfg` in `/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/` folder and insert below lines into the file. 

```json
network: {config: disabled}
```
- Once done run below commands to apply network changes

```sh
# netplan apply
# reboot
```
## How to generate load with OVA ?

This instruction assumes that Load Generator OVA is deployed to Vmware as Virtual Machine using provided instructions. See this link how to deploy OVA: https://github.com/k8-proxy/aws-jmeter-test-engine/blob/master/jmeter-icap/instructions/How-to-Deploy-OVA.md

The following diagram shows generic view of what processes are running and how are they connected:

![vm_load_vision](https://github.com/k8-proxy/aws-jmeter-test-engine/raw/master/jmeter-icap/instructions/img/Icap-Performance-Traffic-Generator-OVA.png)

The load/traffic generator comes with 2 features:

- Load Generation Capability
- Performance Dashboard

* 1. How to use load/traffic generation capability

Load generation can be triggered via provided UI interface.

UI interface looks like this and accessible via http://give-virtual-machine-ip

![vm_load_vision](https://github.com/k8-proxy/aws-jmeter-test-engine/raw/master/jmeter-icap/instructions/img/Load-Generator-UI.png)

The Load Generator UI form has the following options:

- Total Users: 
    - How many total concurrent requests would you like to send? Default: 25
    - Maximum number of total users depends on the Virtual Machine resources:

| vCPU     | RAM | Total Users    | 
| :----:   | :----:   |    :----: |
| 2-4      | 2-4 GB     | 50-500   |
| 4-6  | 8-16  GB      | 500-1000| 
| 8+ | 32+  GB      | 4000| 

- Rampup time: How fast you would like to ramp up total users? Default is 300.
- Duration: How long would you like to generate load? Default is 900
- Load Type: It is possible to generate load directly to ICAP Server or to a Proxy site
- TLS and TLS Ignore Cert Errors: These settings will enable/disable TLS and ignoring of certification errors. Default is both values are on. 
- ICAP/Proxy end point URL: end point url against which load should be run. 
   - **Note** For proxy case, url should be added only to be able to display in dashboard. currently, it runs against only gov.uk offline site and meant for demo purposes only.
- Port: ICAP Server port. For TLS default port is 443. For non-TLS default port is 1344
- Prefix: prefix is used to distinquish different dashboards and measurements. For different kind of load scenarios it is good to use their own prefix so that dashboard view would be unique for that specific scenario

## How to generate load?

Load generation process is simple:

- Ensure that target application under test is up and running
- Open browser and access Load Generation UI http://virtual-machine-ip
- Enter load scenarios based on above description
- Click on Generate Load
- Dashboard link will be shown in the page

![vm_load_vision](https://github.com/k8-proxy/aws-jmeter-test-engine/raw/master/jmeter-icap/instructions/img/Dashboard-Link.png)

## How to use performance dashboard?

After you click Generate Load button, dashboard link for that specific prefix will be shown in the page.

Click that link and it will open dashboard login page:

![vm_load_vision](https://github.com/k8-proxy/aws-jmeter-test-engine/raw/master/jmeter-icap/instructions/img/Grafana-login.png)

Enter admin/glasswall and then dashboard ui will be visible with your own set prefix:

![vm_load_vision](https://github.com/k8-proxy/aws-jmeter-test-engine/raw/master/jmeter-icap/instructions/img/Dashboard-sample.png)

**Note**: Ensure that only one test scenario is running at a time. 

**Note**: Log panel in performance dashboard will show traffic log lines in coming releases.

**Note**: if you would like to stop the test, ssh to VM and find the java process pid, for example, by "top| grep java" command and kill it "sudo kill pid".

# Support Setup
**todo**: add credentials for webmin and guacamole
* Navigate to `https://VM_IP:10000/certmgr/gencsr.cgi?xnavigation=1`
* Pick Generate Key and Certificate Signing Request (CSR), and this is how a request should look like: ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60857664/101491360-52014c00-396c-11eb-9528-8b97730bef00.png)
* Using Guacamole to SSH into your VM, sign the previous request by running:
```
sudo su -
cd /opt/easyrsa
./easyrsa import-req /etc/ssl/csr/hostcsr.pem RequestTest01
./easyrsa sign-req server RequestTest01
```
* DNS Setup:
  * Navigate to `https://VM_IP:10000/bind8/?xnavigation=1` > Under Existing DNS Zones > glasstest.com. You should get this screen, after clicking on glasstest.com
![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60857664/101494034-80ccf180-396f-11eb-9ece-bcb8f4e0b56c.png)
  * Click on addresses. You will see this:

  * For testing: name: third , address: 8.8.8.8 > create
  * in the VM, run `sudo systemctl restart bind9.service`
  * In the VM, run `nslookup` > `server 127.0.0.1` > `third.glasstest.com` (or the name created in previous test). You should get a result that looks like this:
   ```
    Server: 127.0.0.1
    Address: 127.0.0.1#53

    Name: third.glasstest.com
    Address: 8.8.8.8

   ```

# Proxy Rebuild

- Create a VM using proxy-rebuild.ova and login to it.
- Go to `~/vmware-scripts/proxy-rebuild` folder and update git repo:
  ```
  cd ~/vmware-scripts/proxy-rebuild && git pull origin main
  ```
- Run below command to configure IP of the VM after updating it with the IP address of the VM and gateway IP address of our choice.
  ```
  sudo ./01-network-setup.sh <ip_address/nn> <gateway_address>  (example : sudo ./01-network-setup.sh 78.159.113.48/26 78.159.113.62 )
  ```
- Run `02-setup-proxy.sh` to upgrade the helm release with the ICAP server IP address that needs to used by the proxy. When prompted, pass the IP addresses of offline gov.uk and wordpress websites, or hit Enter to use defaults.
  ```
  ./02-setup-proxy.sh <ICAP server IP> (example: ./02-setup-proxy.sh 78.159.113.47)
  ```
- Download ca.pem from VM via `scp glasswall@<VM_IP>:/vmware-scripts/proxy-rebuild/ca.pem <local/directory>`
- In Firefox > Preferences > View Certificates > Authorities > Import ca.pem > Trust this CA to identify websites > OK
- Add below line to the system's hosts file ( C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts on Windows , /etc/hosts on Linux ) for example:
  ```
  <vm_ip_address> glasswallsolutions.com www.glasswallsolutions.com example.local www.example.local gov.uk www.gov.uk assets.publishing.service.gov.uk owasp.org www.owasp.org
  ```
- Open Firefox browser and access [www.glasswallsolutions.com](https://www.glasswallsolutions.com), [gov.uk](gov.uk) websites etc.
