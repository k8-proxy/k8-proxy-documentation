### Client configuration 

* Add hosts records to your client system hosts file ( i.e **Windows**: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts , **Linux, macOS and  Unix-like:** /etc/hosts ) as follows

```
<Deployed OVA VM IP ADDRESS> glasswallsolutions.com.glasswall-icap.com
```

make sure that tcp ports **80** and **443** are reachable and not blocked by firewall.

### Access the proxied site

* You can access the proxied site by browsing [glasswallsolutions.com.glasswall-icap.com](https://glasswallsolutions.com.glasswall-icap.com).
* Verify that your access is established through the haproxy loadbalancer through the network tab, the Request address should show the Loadbalancer server IP as shown below
