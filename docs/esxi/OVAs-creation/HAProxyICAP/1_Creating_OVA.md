Once installation is done restart the VM and press enter when it asks to remove the CD


## Installation

* Following the steps in this documentation we will install HAProxy to work as a load balancer for ICAP server

  https://github.com/k8-proxy/gp-load-balancer/blob/main/haproxy-icap.md

* Clone this repository and run the script for auto install

```bash
cd
git clone https://github.com/k8-proxy/gp-load-balancer
sudo su -
#Please replace the placeholder with your username
cd /home/<username>/gp-load-balancer
./haproxy.sh
```

* Make sure haproxy is active and running

```bash
systemctl status haproxy.service
```

* To confirm functionality telnet your localhost on port 1344 & press 'Enter' multi times as follow

  ```bash
  telnet localhost 1344
  ```

* It should print the following indicating server : C-ICAP/0.5.6

  ```
  Trying 127.0.0.1...
  Connected to localhost.
  Escape character is '^]'.
