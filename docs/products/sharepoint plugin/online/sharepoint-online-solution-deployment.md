This section will outline how to go about installing Glasswall SharePoint solutions to your environment. Glasswall SharePoint solution is offered in 2 flavors. They are:

- **Glasswall - SharePoint Online - Solution**
- **Glasswall - SharePoint Server - Solution** - [link](./../server/sharepoint-server-solution-deployment.md)

## Glasswall - SharePoint Online - Solution Deployment

GW SPO solution consists of the following components:
- **GW SPO Extension**
- **GW FileHandler Web App**

Both components need to be deployed to your environments (M365 + Azure) as described below.

### Prerequsites

- You have setup your Microsoft account (M365 + Azure).
- You have setup [Azure subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/create-subscription).
- Note: You can use 30-day free trial option by setting up account following [steps](https://signup.microsoft.com/Signup?OfferId=B07A1127-DE83-4a6d-9F85-2C104BDAE8B4&dl=ENTERPRISEPACK&culture=en-US&country=US&ali=1). This will setup both Sharepoint and Azure account, accessible on:
    - Sharepoint: `https://<yourTenant>.sharepoint.com/`
    - Azure: `https://portal.azure.com/`

### GW SPO Extension Deployment 
Following are the steps to deploy GW SPO Extension:

#### 1. Download Software

#### 3. Register a new application

The following steps will allow you to register your file handler application.
To register a new application with Azure Active Directory, log into your [**Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Navigate to the **Azure Active Directory** module.
2. Select **App registrations** and click **New application registration**.
   1. Type the name of your file handler application. For e.g. **GlasswallFileHandlerApp**
   2. Ensure **Application Type** is set to **Web app / API**
   3. Enter a sign-on URL for your application. This will be `https://app-glasswallfilehandler-prod.azurewebsites.net`.
   4. Click **Create** to create the app.
3. After the app has been created successfully, from Azure Active Directory, left side menu choose **App registrations** and select the app (created in step 2) from the list of applications.
4. Make a note of **Application ID** for the app you registered. 
5. Make a note of the **Object ID** for this application, since you will need this later to register the file handler manifest.
6. Configure the application settings for this sample:
   1. Select **Authentication** from left bar, choose to **Add platform**, select **web** and add **Redirect URIs** as the one setup in 2.3 (e.g. `https://app-glasswallfilehandler-prod.azurewebsites.net/signin-oidc`) is added.
   2. Select **API Permissions**, click to **Add a permission**, choose **Microsoft Graph** and select **Deligated permissions**. Under **Files** find the permission **Have full access to all files user can access** and check the box next to it, then click **Select**, and then **Done**.
   3. Under **API Permissions**, click **Grant Admin Consent** button, to grant access for above permission.
   4. Select **Ceriticates and Secrets** and choose to add **New Client Secret** by entering a description for the key, selecting a duration, and then click **Save**. Make a note of the `Client Value` and `Client ID` displayed, since it will only be displayed once.
7. From Azure Active Directory, left side menu choose **Enterprise application** and select the app (created in step 2) from the list of applications.
   1. From the left side menu select **Properties**
   2. Set **Enabled for users to sign-in?** to `Yes`
   3. Set **Visible to users?** to `Yes`
   4. Click **Save** in top bar menu


#### 4. Register the file handler manifest

- After registering your app with Azure Active Directory, you can upload the file handler manifest information into the application.
1. Select **Manifest** from left menu
2. In displayed editor under **Addins** add below file handler manifest (make sure to change url to correspond to the one you added and add new ID by generating random GUID) and Save

```
[
    {
        "id": "<Enter New GUID here>",
        "type": "FileHandler",
        "properties": [
            { "key": "version","value": "2"},
            { "key": "appIcon", "value": "{\"svg\":\"<Enter application icon here>\" }"},
            { "key": "actions", "value": "[{\"type\":\"custom\",\"url\":\"https://app-glasswallfilehandler-prod.azurewebsites.net/filehandler/download\",\"displayName\": \"Download (Glasswall)\",\"shortDisplayName\": \"Download (Glasswall)\", \"availableOn\":{\"file\":{\"extensions\":[\"*\"]}}}]"}
        ]
    }
]
```

- For detailed instructions on how to upload the file handler manifest, see [Registering file handlers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/file-handlers/register-manually).


#### 5. Update FileHandler Application Settings
Following application settings of FileHandler web app configuration needs to be updated.
- Navigate to **App Service** and choose web app you created in previous steps. 
- Select **Configuration** from left bar menu and click **New application settings** button in top bar.
- Add below values (ex. `Name` is `AzureAd:ClientId`, `Value` is `client ID from step 3.7`
1. AzureAd:ClientId - Client Id of the App registered with Azure Active Directory 
2. AzureAd:ClientSecret - Client Secret created in App registered with Azure Active Directory 
3. AzureAd:Domain - Domain of your O365 subscription. For e.g. glasswall.onmicrosoft.com.
4. AzureAd:TenantId - Tenant id of your Azure Active Directory tenant.  
5. Glasswall:BaseUrl - Base url of your Glasswall GW Cloud SDK endpoint. Make sure you are using valid URL.
6. Glasswall:ApiKey - Api Key to access the Glasswall GW Cloud SDK (can be found [here](https://glasswall-store.com/products/glasswall-rebuild-cloud-in-shared-cloud-environment?variant=33739907006604)).

#### 6. Deploy FileHandler Code
1. Navigate to local folder where GWO365FileHandlerWebApp.zip was downloaded (from [FileHandler release](https://github.com/k8-proxy/gp-sharepoint-plugins/releases)).
2. Make sure you have **az cli** install on your workstation.
3. Deploy the code to your Azure Web App by following instructions from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-run-package) or based on example below (make sure to add corresponding values for resource-group, app name and path to fileHandler).

```
az login
az webapp deployment source config-zip --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name> --src /path/to/<filename>.zip
```
#### 7. Verify Solution

1. Clean cache
    - File handlers are cached locally in the browser and on the server. These caches have a timeout of 24 hours, meaning it can take up to 48 hours for updates to a File Handler manifest to appear for users. More details about this can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/file-handlers/reset-cache?view=odsp-graph-online).
    - In case you want to test your changes in less then 24h you will need to clean cache. While being authenticate to your sharepoint account in new tab, run: `https://{tenant}-my.sharepoint.com/_api/v2.0/drive/apps?forceRefresh=1`
    - Navigate to your sharepoint `https://{tenant}.sharepoint.com/` and from dev console, clean local and session storage cache.
    - Navigate to your oneDrive `https://{tenant}-my.sharepoint.com/` and from dev console, clean local and session storage cache.
    - Close your Browser.
    - Open your Browser again and access your Sharepoint (e.g. `https://{tenant}.sharepoint.com/`).
    - In the new tab run `https://{tenant}-my.sharepoint.com/_api/v2.0/drive/apps`.
    - Make sure as an output you get your addins content.
    
```
{"@odata.context":"https://{tenant}.sharepoint.com/_api/v2.0/$metadata#driveApps","value":[{"application":{"id":"  <APPID>","displayName":"GlasswallFileHandlerApp"},"fileHandler":{"appIcon":{"png1x":"https://glasswallsolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/File-Drop-700.png"},"fileTypeDisplayName":"Glasswall(.NETFW)","fileTypeIcon":{"png1x":"https://glasswallsolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/File-Drop-700.png"},"fileTypeIconUrl":"https://glasswallsolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/File-Drop-700.png","version":2},"hidden":false,"id":"<GUID>"}]}
```
   
2. Navigate back to SharePoint Online (O365) Site.
3. Open any Document Library.
4. Select any file. 
5. Verify custom Download button is present. 
6. Download the file.
   - In case you are not able to **Download** file, verify that correct Glasswall Rebuild URL and GW Cloud SDK are set in section 5.
8. Verify that downloaded file is rebuilt by Glasswall (you can upload file to `https://file-drop.co.uk` and verify it comes clean).
   - If the file is not rebuild correctly, the issue has to do with Glasswall Rebuild rather than solution provided.
