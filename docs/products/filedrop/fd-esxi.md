- Click on **Console** in top left corner and select "Open browser console"
- Login to VM using provided credentials
- Change network configuration by running network wizard:

  ```
  /usr/local/bin/wizard
  ```

- Add IP, Gateway and DNS addresses
   - Note: Use `bottom arrow` to navigate through these 3 fields and `tab` to move to Submit button
   - Note: To set up your OVA **without internet access**, for `DNS`, enter the same IP as your VM IP.

- **Important note**: After the IP change wizard will return to the same window, navigate back to CMD by pressing `Cancel` 
- If needed, you can use wizard to change password by selecting **Change password**
- Verify that correct IP address is set by running `ip -4 a` and verifying IP for `eth0`

- Give the VM ~10 minutes to initialize, then open your browser and access FileDrop UI on `http://<VM IP>`

### Troubleshooting

- If the UI does not load, run `kubectl get pod -A` to check the status of pods
- If their status is not `ready`, in home directory run `./flush_iptables.sh`
- Then run `sudo systemctl restart k3s`
- Give it ~5-10 minutes, and then navigate to `http://<VM IP>`

  - to increase disk size, `Ctrl+D`> Pick your K8-Rebuild VM > Properties
  - if size hasn't been updated on the VM, run:
     ```
     sudo growpart /dev/sda1
     sudo resize2fs /dev/sda1
     ```
