GW Cloud SDK is a Kubernetes service that can be added to ICAP infrastructure to provide access to Glasswall Solutions file rebuild service through RESTful APIs.

## Architecture Overview
- Implemented as a K8s service
- Easy to deploy within ICAP Service cluster
- Interacts with Adaptation Service with RabbitMQ
- Accessible on :8080

- The C# service receives files for a rebuild on the REST API endpoints.
- After preliminary processing (at least must verify the file has been received), the request is passed to the `Adaption Service` with `Adaption request` RabbitMQ message.
- The file to be rebuilt is uploaded to the `Original Store`.
- Once the processing is completed, C# service gets informed with a RabbitMQ `Adaption outcome` message.
- C# service get the rebuilt file from the `Rebuild Store` and passes it to the user.
